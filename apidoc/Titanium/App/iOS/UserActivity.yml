name: Titanium.App.iOS.UserActivity
description: |
    The UserActivity module is used to enable device Handoff and to create User Activites first introduced in iOS8 and the CoreSpotLight feature 
    introduced in iOS9.  UserActivity requires the activityType to be specified at creation time.  Additional properties can be
    created either at creation or set individually after creation.

    Handoff will not work in the simulator.  You must build and run on a compatible device.

    Handoff functionality depends on few things:
        * You must be logged in to the same iCloud account on each device you wish to use Handoff.
        * Handoff broadcasts activities via Bluetooth LE signals, so both the broadcasting and receiving devices must have Bluetooth LE 4.0 support.
        * Devices should have been already paired through iCloud. Make sure you login using the same iCloud account.

    Make sure you have two Handoff compatible devices running iOS 8 or later that are logged onto the same iCloud account.

  - title: Creating a new UserActivity Example
    example: |
        The following example demonstrates how to create a new UserActivity and mark the activity as
        the current activity Handoff should be using when switching between devices.
        
        It is important to note that all activityTypes must be defined in your tiapp.xml before this
        feature can be supported.  It is important to check the supported property on your UserActivity
        to ensure the activity created is supported on your device.
        
        #### app.js

            var activity =  Ti.App.iOS.createUserActivity({
            activityType:'com.setdirection.home',
                title:'activity 1',
                userInfo:{
                    msg:"hello world"
                }
            });

            if(!activity.supported){
                alert('activity not supported');
                return;
            }
            activity.becomeCurrent();
